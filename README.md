In this beginner-level project, I aimed to replicate the fundamental features of an e-commerce website to gain valuable hands-on experience in front-end development. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a basic user interface that emulates the look and feel of a typical online shopping platform.

The project allowed me to explore various web development concepts and techniques, such as structuring the webpage using HTML, styling it with CSS to ensure a visually appealing design, and implementing interactive functionalities using JavaScript. I focused on creating a responsive design to ensure that the UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a user-friendly experience across various devices.

Throughout the project, I gained practical experience in building webpages, handling user interactions, and refining my skills in coding, debugging, and problem-solving. By replicating key e-commerce features such as product listings, search functionality, and a simple shopping cart system, I developed a foundational understanding of how front-end technologies work together to create engaging and interactive web experiences.

This project served as an excellent starting point for my journey into web development, laying the groundwork for more advanced projects and further exploration of the ever-evolving field of front-end development.![amazon_img_1](https://github.com/Charuuu1/Amazon_Clone/assets/139768950/4ba3fc85-e345-44c5-bcb4-f8a958233aaf)
